### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Hamza Eljaouhari, a passionate developer with a love for electric guitar, basketball, coding, and movies. I've been playing the electric guitar for about 15 years and enjoy combining my interests in technology and music.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

#### Cryptographical Keys Lifecycle Management Application

This project is designed to handle the lifecycle of cryptographic keys for both AES and RSA encryption. It includes functionalities for creating, activating, deactivating, archiving, recovering, revoking, and destroying keys. The project supports AES with key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, and RSA with key sizes of 1024, 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits.

- [.NET Core API](https://github.com/hamza-eljaouhari/klms-net-core)

#### Interactive Fretboard and Circle of Fifths

The Interactive Fretboard and Circle of Fifths project is designed to assist musicians, particularly guitarists, in improving their skills, composing music, and learning new songs on the guitar. By combining a dynamic fretboard visualization with the Circle of Fifths, this tool provides an intuitive interface for exploring musical concepts and practicing techniques.

#### Healer - Food Supplements Suggester

Healer is a Food Supplements Suggester designed to assist users in improving their nutritional intake and addressing specific health concerns through the recommendation of suitable food supplements. By providing functionalities such as nutritional medical results analysis and symptom evaluation, Healer offers personalized recommendations tailored to individual needs.
